# RepCard Sync Fixes - Appointment Validation & Error Handling

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Appointment Sync Failures (1114 records failed)
**Problem**: Appointments were failing to sync with 0 fetched but 1114 failures, indicating validation errors were causing silent failures.

**Root Causes**:
- Missing `appointment.contact.id` validation
- Missing required timestamp fields (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
- Poor error handling leading to silent failures
- SQL conditional fragments causing syntax errors

### 2. Build Failures
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors due to missing `try` block wrapper and brace mismatches.

**Fix**: Added proper `try-catch` structure around user enrichment code in both `syncCustomers` and `syncAppointments` functions.

## Fixes Applied

### Appointment Validation
```typescript
// Validate appointment structure before processing
if (!appointment || !appointment.id) {
  console.warn(`[RepCard Sync] Skipping invalid appointment (missing id):`, appointment);
  recordsFailed++;
  continue;
}

if (!appointment.contact || !appointment.contact.id) {
  console.warn(`[RepCard Sync] Skipping appointment ${appointment.id} - missing contact information`);
  recordsFailed++;
  continue;
}

if (!appointment.createdAt || !appointment.updatedAt) {
  console.warn(`[RepCard Sync] Appointment ${appointment.id} missing required timestamps, skipping`);
  recordsFailed++;
  continue;
}
```

### Improved Error Handling
- Added detailed error logging with stack traces
- Log first 5 failed appointments for debugging
- Continue processing even if user enrichment fails
- Better error messages showing what data was missing

### Office ID Lookup
- Sequential queries instead of conditional SQL fragments
- Handles missing `userId`/`closerId` gracefully
- Falls back through customer → setter → closer

### User Enrichment Error Handling
- Wrapped user enrichment in `try-catch` blocks
- Continue processing even if user check fails
- Proper error logging

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Valid appointments**: Will sync successfully
2. **Invalid appointments**: Will be skipped with clear warnings, incrementing `recordsFailed` counter
3. **Error logging**: Detailed error messages in console/logs showing why appointments failed
4. **Build**: Successful compilation and deployment

## Next Steps

1. Trigger a new sync to test the fixes
2. Monitor sync logs for any remaining validation issues
3. Review failed appointment logs to understand data quality issues
4. If needed, add additional validation rules based on patterns found

## Testing

Run a sync and check:
- `recordsFetched` should increase for valid appointments
- `recordsFailed` should only count truly invalid appointments
- Console logs should show detailed error messages for failed appointments
- Build should complete successfully
