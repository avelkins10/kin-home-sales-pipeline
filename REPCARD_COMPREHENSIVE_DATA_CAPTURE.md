# RepCard Comprehensive Data Capture ‚úÖ

## Overview

All RepCard API endpoints are now fully integrated with comprehensive data capture, proper attribution, and calculated metrics.

---

## ‚úÖ What's Captured

### 1. **All Endpoints Synced**
- ‚úÖ Users (`/users/minimal`, `/users/{id}/details`)
- ‚úÖ Offices (`/offices`)
- ‚úÖ Customers (`/customers`) - All door knocks/leads
- ‚úÖ Appointments (`/appointments`) - All appointments with full details
- ‚úÖ Status Logs (`/customers/status-logs`) - All status changes
- ‚úÖ Customer Attachments (`/customers/attachments`) - Power bills, documents
- ‚úÖ Appointment Attachments (`/appointments/attachments`) - Appointment-specific files

### 2. **Proper Attribution**
- ‚úÖ **Setter** - User who knocked door/created customer (from `appointment.userId` or `customer.assignedUserId`)
- ‚úÖ **Closer** - User who runs appointment (from `appointment.closerId`)
- ‚úÖ **Office** - Inherited from customer ‚Üí setter ‚Üí closer (priority order)
- ‚úÖ **Customer** - Links appointments to customers via `repcard_customer_id`

### 3. **All Statuses & Dispositions**
- ‚úÖ **Cancelled** - Appointments marked as cancelled
- ‚úÖ **Rescheduled** - Appointments that were rescheduled
- ‚úÖ **No Show** - Appointments where customer didn't show
- ‚úÖ **Sat Closed** - Appointment completed, sale closed
- ‚úÖ **Sat No Close** - Appointment completed, no sale
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Appointment finished (has `completed_at`)
- ‚úÖ **Scheduled** - Appointment scheduled (has `scheduled_at`)
- ‚úÖ **Pending** - Default status for new appointments

### 4. **Calculated Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **Within 48 Hours** - Appointment created within 48 hours of customer creation (`is_within_48_hours`)
- ‚úÖ **Has Power Bill** - Customer has power bill attachment (`has_power_bill`)
- ‚úÖ **Status Category** - Normalized status category from disposition (`status_category`)

### 5. **Relationships & Joins**
- ‚úÖ Customer ‚Üí Appointments (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ Customer ‚Üí Attachments (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ Appointment ‚Üí Attachments (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ Customer ‚Üí Status Logs (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ User ‚Üí Customers (setter) (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ User ‚Üí Appointments (setter/closer) (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ Office ‚Üí Users (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ Office ‚Üí Customers (one-to-many)
- ‚úÖ Office ‚Üí Appointments (one-to-many)

## üìä Database Schema

### `repcard_appointments` Table (Enhanced)
```sql
-- New fields added:
office_id INTEGER                    -- Inherited from customer/setter/closer
is_within_48_hours BOOLEAN          -- Calculated from customer.created_at
has_power_bill BOOLEAN              -- Calculated from attachments
status_category TEXT                -- Normalized: cancelled, rescheduled, no_show, sat_closed, sat_no_close, completed, scheduled, pending
```

### Automatic Triggers
- **`trigger_update_appointment_metrics`** - Auto-calculates `is_within_48_hours`, `office_id`, `status_category` on insert/update
- **`trigger_update_power_bill_status`** - Auto-updates `has_power_bill` flag when attachments are synced

## üîç Query Examples

### Get Appointments Within 48 Hours
```sql
SELECT * FROM repcard_appointments
WHERE setter_user_id = 123
  AND is_within_48_hours = TRUE
  AND created_at >= '2025-01-01'::timestamp;
```

### Get Appointments With Power Bill
```sql
SELECT * FROM repcard_appointments
WHERE setter_user_id = 123
  AND has_power_bill = TRUE;
```

### Get All Dispositions for a Setter
```sql
SELECT 
  disposition,
  status_category,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM repcard_appointments
WHERE setter_user_id = 123
GROUP BY disposition, status_category
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Get Office Metrics
```sql
SELECT 
  office_id,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE is_within_48_hours = TRUE) as within_48h,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE has_power_bill = TRUE) as with_power_bill,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status_category = 'sat_closed') as closed,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status_category = 'cancelled') as cancelled
FROM repcard_appointments
WHERE office_id = 456
GROUP BY office_id;
```

## üöÄ Helper Functions

### `lib/repcard/metrics-calculations.ts`

**Get Appointment Metrics for User:**
```typescript
const metrics = await getAppointmentMetricsForUser(
  repcardUserId: number,
  startDate?: string,
  endDate?: string,
  role: 'setter' | 'closer' | 'both' = 'both'
);
// Returns: { total, within48Hours, withPowerBill, cancelled, rescheduled, noShow, satClosed, satNoClose, completed, scheduled }
```

**Get Appointments Within 48 Hours:**
```typescript
const count = await getAppointmentsWithin48Hours(repcardUserId, startDate, endDate);
```

**Get Appointments With Power Bill:**
```typescript
const count = await getAppointmentsWithPowerBill(repcardUserId, startDate, endDate);
```

**Get All Dispositions:**
```typescript
const dispositions = await getAllDispositionsForUser(repcardUserId, startDate, endDate, 'setter');
// Returns: [{ disposition: 'sat_closed', count: 10 }, ...]
```

**Get Office Metrics:**
```typescript
const metrics = await getOfficeMetrics(officeId, startDate, endDate);
```

## üìà Sync Process

### Comprehensive Sync Order:
1. **Users** ‚Üí Needed for attribution
2. **Offices** ‚Üí Needed for office data
3. **Customers** ‚Üí Base data (door knocks)
4. **Appointments** ‚Üí Links to customers, calculates metrics
5. **Status Logs** ‚Üí Tracks status changes
6. **Customer Attachments** ‚Üí Power bills, documents
7. **Appointment Attachments** ‚Üí Appointment-specific files
8. **Update Power Bill Flags** ‚Üí After attachments sync
9. **Link Users** ‚Üí Match RepCard users to `users` table

### Incremental Sync:
- Default sync uses last 30 days (configurable)
- Only fetches new/updated records since last sync
- Automatically calculates all metrics and fields
- Runs every 10 minutes via cron job

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run Migration**: `npm run migrate:repcard-comprehensive-fields`
2. **Trigger Sync**: Visit `/admin/trigger-sync` and click "Sync Recent Data (30 days)"
3. **Verify Data**: Check that appointments have `office_id`, `is_within_48_hours`, `has_power_bill`, `status_category`
4. **Test Queries**: Use helper functions to verify metrics are calculated correctly

## üìù Notes

- **Forward-Looking Sync**: Default sync is last 30 days (faster, avoids timeouts)
- **Historical Data**: Can backfill with "Backfill (90 days)" or "Full Historical Sync" options
- **Auto-Refresh**: Frontend components refresh every 30 seconds
- **Incremental Sync**: Cron job runs every 10 minutes automatically
