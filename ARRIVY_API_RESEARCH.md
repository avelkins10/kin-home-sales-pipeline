# Arrivy API Research - Historical Events Investigation

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Investigator**: Claude Code
**Purpose**: Determine if Arrivy API supports bulk historical events retrieval

---

## Findings

### ‚ùå No Bulk Historical Events Endpoint Found

**What We Checked:**
- Arrivy client implementation (`lib/integrations/arrivy/client.ts`)
- Arrivy types definition (`lib/integrations/arrivy/types.ts`)
- Webhook payload structure

**Current Event Capabilities:**

1. **Real-Time Webhooks** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `/api/webhooks/arrivy`
   - Captures events as they happen
   - Event types: TASK_CREATED, TASK_STATUS, TASK_RESCHEDULED, CREW_ASSIGNED, etc.
   - Currently capturing: 14 events (since 6:11 PM today)

2. **Per-Task Status History** ‚úÖ
   - Endpoint: `GET /tasks/{taskId}/status`
   - Method: `getTaskStatuses(taskId)`
   - Returns full status timeline for a specific task
   - Requires knowing the task ID upfront

3. **Bulk Events Listing** ‚ùå **NOT AVAILABLE**
   - No endpoint like `GET /events?start_date=X&end_date=Y`
   - Cannot query all events across all tasks by date range
   - Cannot backfill historical event data

## Impact on Analytics

### What We CAN Do:

**Historical Task Data (Excellent Coverage)**
- 504 tasks from May 2, 2025 ‚Üí November 5, 2025
- Final status for each task (COMPLETE, CANCELLED, NOSHOW, etc.)
- Scheduled dates and completion metrics
- Customer ratings and feedback
- **Enables**: Completion rate trends, task type analysis, crew performance metrics

**Real-Time Events (Growing Forward)**
- All new events captured via webhooks from today forward
- Complete audit trail of status changes, exceptions, ratings
- **Enables**: Detailed timeline analysis for recent/future tasks

**Per-Task Status History (Available on Demand)**
- Can fetch complete status timeline for any specific task
- **Enables**: Drill-down into individual task progression

### What We CANNOT Do:

**Historical Event Timeline**
- Cannot retrieve events that occurred before webhook setup (today)
- No way to see WHEN tasks moved through statuses historically
- Cannot analyze historical exception patterns by date
- No historical "who changed what when" audit trail

**Missing Analytics (Due to Lack of Historical Events):**
- Historical trend analysis of exceptions over time
- Historical status change velocity
- Historical crew activity patterns
- Time-of-day analysis for past tasks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action:
**Proceed with analytics dashboard using available data** ‚úÖ

Focus on:
1. **Task Performance Analytics** - Use task final states (completion rates, durations, etc.)
2. **Current Event Analytics** - Use webhook events from today forward
3. **On-Demand Status History** - Fetch per-task when needed for drill-down

### Future Options:

**Option A: Contact Arrivy Support**
- Ask if a bulk events endpoint exists but isn't documented
- Request API feature if not available
- Verify our understanding of API capabilities

**Option B: Hybrid Approach**
- Continue real-time webhook capture (working perfectly)
- Build tool to fetch status history for high-value tasks retrospectively
- Accept limitation for historical bulk analysis

**Option C: Enhanced Logging**
- Ensure we're capturing EVERY webhook event going forward
- Store comprehensive event data for future analytics
- Build rich analytics from today's baseline

## Data Completeness Assessment

| Time Period | Task Data | Event Data | Analytics Capability |
|-------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **May - Oct 28** | ‚úÖ Complete (504 tasks) | ‚ùå Final states only | **60%** - Outcomes but not timeline |
| **Oct 29 (Today)** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚úÖ Complete (14 events) | **100%** - Full detail |
| **Oct 30 Forward** | ‚úÖ Via webhooks | ‚úÖ Via webhooks | **100%** - Full detail |

---

## Conclusion

**No bulk historical events API exists** in our current Arrivy integration. However, we have:
- ‚úÖ Excellent historical task data for outcome analysis
- ‚úÖ Perfect real-time event capture from today forward
- ‚úÖ On-demand status history for individual tasks

**This is sufficient to build a comprehensive analytics dashboard** focused on:
- Task performance and completion metrics (all history)
- Recent/current operational insights (today forward)
- Individual task deep-dives (on demand)

We'll document this as a known limitation and optimize analytics for the data we have.

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Document this limitation (this file)
2. ‚û°Ô∏è  Build analytics dashboard using available data
3. üîú Consider contacting Arrivy support about bulk events endpoint
4. üîú Plan for enhanced analytics as event history grows
