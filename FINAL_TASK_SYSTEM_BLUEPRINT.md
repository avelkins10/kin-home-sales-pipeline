## TASK STATUS WORKFLOW

### Observed Status Values

From live data analysis:

**Task Statuses (Field 9)**:
1. **Not Started** - Rep hasn't submitted anything
2. **In Progress** - Rep has created submission(s)
3. **Approved** - Ops approved a submission
4. **Closed by Ops** - Ops closed without approval

**Submission Statuses (Field 7)**:
1. **Pending Approval** - Waiting for ops review
2. **Reviewed** - Ops has reviewed
3. **Approved** - Disposition is approved

**Ops Review Dispositions (Field 8)**:
1. **Approved** - Good to go
2. **Needs Revision** - Rep must resubmit
3. **N/A** - Not yet reviewed

### Recommended Workflow Logic

```
1. Task Created â†’ Status: "Not Started"
2. Rep Uploads â†’ Create Submission, Task Status: "In Progress"
3. Ops Reviews:
   a. Approve â†’ Submission Status: "Reviewed", Disposition: "Approved"
               Task Status: "Approved"
   b. Reject â†’ Submission Status: "Reviewed", Disposition: "Needs Revision"
               Task Status: stays "In Progress"
4. If all tasks in group approved â†’ Trigger next workflow step
```

## EDGE CASES & SPECIAL SCENARIOS

### Multiple Submissions (Resubmissions)

**Example**: Utility Bill: Wrong Address UB had 3 submissions
- Submission 1: Pending Approval
- Submission 2: Pending Approval
- Submission 3: Approved

**Handling**:
- Field 13 (Is Max Submission?) identifies the latest
- Always show latest submission status to rep
- Allow ops to see full submission history

### Closed by Ops

Some tasks get closed without approval:
- Consumption Audit: Not Enough Usage
- Utility Bill: Usage Missing/Blurry UB

**Handling**:
- Display as "Resolved" or "Closed" to rep
- Don't count toward "unapproved" tasks
- Consider separate "Closed" status in UI

### Multiple File Uploads

Tasks can have up to 3 files per submission:
- Field 9: File Upload (primary)
- Field 25: File Upload 1
- Field 26: File Upload 2

**Handling**:
- Allow rep to upload multiple files
- Display all files in ops review
- Consider task type requirements (some may need multiple docs)

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Validate Rep Authentication (Day 1)
- [ ] Confirm Field 356 (Closer - Email) is unique per rep
- [ ] Test login with sample emails
- [ ] Verify email format consistency

### 2. Build Query Functions (Day 2-3)
- [ ] `getProjectsForRep(email)` â†’ uses Field 356
- [ ] `getTaskGroupsForProject(projectId)` â†’ uses Field 10
- [ ] `getTasksForGroup(groupId)` â†’ uses Field 6
- [ ] `getSubmissionsForTask(taskId)` â†’ uses Field 6

### 3. Create UI Mockups (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Task list screen
- [ ] Task detail with upload
- [ ] Ops review screen
- [ ] Notification templates

### 4. Set Up Dev Environment (Day 6-7)
- [ ] QuickBase API integration
- [ ] File upload handler
- [ ] Authentication system
- [ ] Database schema (if caching)

### 5. Build MVP (Week 2-4)
- [ ] Implement Phase 1 (Task List)
- [ ] Add Phase 2 (Document Upload)
- [ ] Test with real QuickBase data
- [ ] Get feedback from 2-3 reps
