# Traycer AI Implementation Guide - Kin Home Rep Dashboard

This guide provides AI-specific instructions for implementing the Kin Home Rep Dashboard using Traycer (or similar AI coding assistants like Cursor Composer, GitHub Copilot, etc.).

---

## Overview

Traycer is an AI coding assistant that can generate entire features from detailed specifications. This guide shows you how to use Traycer effectively to build the dashboard.

**Total Implementation Time**: 2-3 hours (with AI assistance)

---

## Setup

### 1. Load Context

Before starting, ensure Traycer has access to these files:

```
@docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md
@lib/constants/fieldIds.ts
@lib/types/project.ts
@lib/quickbase/client.ts
@components/ui/* (all shadcn components)
```

### 2. Set Project Context

Tell Traycer about your project:

```
This is a Next.js 14 dashboard for solar installation sales reps. We use:
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui components
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Quickbase as our backend

We're building 3 pages: Dashboard, Projects List, and Project Detail.
All specifications are in @docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Utilities First (15 minutes)

Build all utility functions first since they have no UI dependencies.

#### Prompt 1.1: Hold Detection

```
Create lib/utils/hold-detection.ts based on section 6.2 of @docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md

Requirements:
- detectHoldStatus(status) function that checks if PROJECT_STATUS contains hold keywords
- extractHoldType(status) function that returns hold type (finance, roof, customer, etc.)
- Hold keywords: "On Hold", "Finance Hold", "Roof Hold", "Customer Hold", "Permit Hold", "HOA Hold"
- Return types should be properly typed
```

**Verify**: Check that both functions are exported and typed correctly.

---

#### Prompt 1.2: Project Helpers

```
Create lib/utils/project-helpers.ts based on section 6.3 of @docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md

Requirements:
- parseCustomerName(fullName): Split into firstName and lastName
  - Handle edge cases: single word, empty string
  - Last word is always lastName, everything else is firstName
- formatAddress(address): Split into line1 (street) and line2 (city, state, zip)
  - Split on commas
  - First part is line1, rest joined with commas is line2
- getProjectAge(project): Calculate days since sale
  - Use PROJECT_AGE field if available, otherwise calculate from SALES_DATE
- getInstallDate(project): Get install dates with backup field hierarchy
  - scheduled: Use fields 710, 178, 1124, 835 in order (first non-empty)
  - started: Use field 464
  - completed: Use fields 534, 587, 2006 in order
- getInstallRescheduleHistory(project): Return array of all install date changes
  - Include date and source label
  - Sort by date descending (most recent first)

Use @lib/constants/fieldIds.ts for field references
Use @lib/types/project.ts for QuickbaseProject type
```

**Verify**: Test each function with sample data.

---

#### Prompt 1.3: Traffic Light Logic

```
Create lib/utils/traffic-lights.ts based on section 6.1 of @docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md

This is the MOST COMPLEX utility - implement carefully.

Requirements:
- Export types: MilestoneId, MilestoneState
- calculateMilestoneState(project, milestoneId): Returns state for each milestone
  - States: 'complete', 'in-progress', 'pending', 'on-hold', 'overdue'
  - 7 milestones: intake, survey, design, nem, permit, install, inspection
  - Each milestone has specific completion criteria (see spec section 6.1)
  - If project is on hold, current milestone shows 'on-hold' state
- getMilestoneStatusText(project): Returns status text like "NEM: Submitted 12/28 ‚Ä¢ 5d waiting"
  - Format depends on current milestone
  - Show submission dates and days waiting for NEM and Permit
  - Show scheduled/started dates for Install

Helper functions needed:
- calculateIntakeState(project)
- calculateSurveyState(project)
- calculateDesignState(project)
- calculateNEMState(project)
- calculatePermitState(project)
- calculateInstallState(project)
- calculateInspectionState(project)
- getCurrentMilestoneId(project)
- calculateDaysWaiting(submitDate)
- formatDate(dateStr) - format as MM/DD

Use @lib/constants/fieldIds.ts for all field references
Use @lib/utils/hold-detection.ts for detectHoldStatus
```

**Verify**: Test with projects at different stages. Ensure states are correct.

---

### Phase 2: Shared Components (30 minutes)

Build reusable UI components that multiple pages will use.

#### Prompt 2.1: PPW Display

```
Create components/projects/PPWDisplay.tsx based on section 5.2 of @docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md

- Shows both Sold PPW and Commissionable PPW
- Calculate delta: commissionablePPW - soldPPW
- Delta color: green if positive, red if negative, gray if zero
- Delta icon: ArrowUp if positive, ArrowDown if negative, Minus if zero
- Compact mode (default): Shows both values inline with delta
- Expanded mode: Shows values in rows with labels
- Handle null values gracefully (show "N/A")

Use lucide-react icons: ArrowDown, ArrowUp, Minus
```

**Verify**: Test with different PPW combinations (positive delta, negative delta, equal, null values).

---

## Query Implementation

You'll need to implement several query functions in `lib/quickbase/queries.ts`. Here's a guide:

### getDashboardMetrics

```typescript
export async function getDashboardMetrics(userId: string, role: string) {
  // Query 1: Count installs this week (INSTALL_COMPLETED_DATE in current week)
  // Query 2: Count active projects (NOT on hold, NOT completed, NOT cancelled)
  // Query 3: Count on hold projects + breakdown by type
  // Query 4: Count installs this month

  // Return object with all metrics
}
```

### getUrgentProjects

```typescript
export async function getUrgentProjects(userId: string, role: string) {
  // Query projects where:
  // - PROJECT_STATUS contains 'Hold'
  // - DATE_ON_HOLD > 7 days ago
  // Sort by DATE_ON_HOLD ASC (oldest first)
  // Return: recordId, customerName, daysOnHold, holdReason
}
```

### getProjectsForUser

```typescript
export async function getProjectsForUser(
  userId: string,
  role: string,
  view: string,
  search?: string
) {
  // Build where clause based on:
  // - Role-based filtering (closer, office_leader, regional, etc.)
  // - View filtering (active, on-hold, install-ready, etc.)
  // - Search filtering (by customer name or project ID)

  // See CURSOR-INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed filter logic
}
```

---

## Testing Strategy

After implementing each phase, test thoroughly:

### Phase 1 Tests (Utilities)
```
Test parseCustomerName with:
- "John Smith" ‚Üí {firstName: "John", lastName: "Smith"}
- "John David Martinez" ‚Üí {firstName: "John David", lastName: "Martinez"}
- "Madonna" ‚Üí {firstName: "Madonna", lastName: ""}

Test traffic light states with projects at different milestones
```

### Phase 2 Tests (Components)
```
Test PPWDisplay with:
- soldPPW: 3.20, commissionablePPW: 2.80 ‚Üí Shows red delta
- soldPPW: 3.00, commissionablePPW: 3.20 ‚Üí Shows green delta
- soldPPW: 3.00, commissionablePPW: 3.00 ‚Üí Shows gray neutral
```

### Phase 3 Tests (Dashboard)
```
Visit / and verify:
- Metrics display correct counts
- Urgent alerts show when projects on hold > 7 days
- Recent projects link to detail pages
```

### Phase 4 Tests (Projects List)
```
Visit /projects and verify:
- All filters work and update URL
- Search filters correctly
- Traffic lights show correct states
- Can click into projects
```

### Phase 5 Tests (Project Detail)
```
Click into project and verify:
- All tabs render
- Timeline shows all dates
- Reschedule history displays
- Back button works
```

## Common Prompts

### "Fix TypeScript errors"
```
Fix all TypeScript errors in this file. Ensure:
- All imports are correct
- All props are properly typed
- All functions return correct types
- No 'any' types used
```

### "Make it responsive"
```
Make this component responsive for iPad Pro 11" and 13" in landscape mode.
Use Tailwind breakpoints:
- sm: 640px
- md: 768px
- lg: 1024px
- xl: 1280px
```

### "Add loading states"
```
Add proper loading states with skeleton loaders.
Use Skeleton component from @components/ui/skeleton
Match the layout of the actual content
```

---

## Optimization Tips

1. **Use Traycer's context feature**: Always reference the spec with `@docs/TRAYCER-UI-SPEC.md`
2. **Build incrementally**: Test each component before moving to the next
3. **Use specific prompts**: Don't ask "build the dashboard" - ask for one component at a time
4. **Verify types**: Always check that TypeScript is happy
5. **Test interactivity**: Click everything to ensure links and buttons work

---

## Troubleshooting

### Traycer generates wrong code
- **Solution**: Be more specific in your prompt. Reference exact section numbers from spec.

### TypeScript errors
- **Solution**: Ask Traycer to "Fix all TypeScript errors" and provide the error messages

### Components not rendering
- **Solution**: Check imports. Ask Traycer to "verify all imports are correct"

### Styling looks wrong
- **Solution**: Reference specific Tailwind classes from spec. Ask to "match the mockup exactly"
