## Production Readiness Assessment

### Executive Summary
- Overall: ~85% ready; two primary blockers resolved by adding CI/CD and QA docs.
- Key wins: security hardening, auth, RBAC, offline support, tests.
- Remaining: execute manual QA; complete dashboard/projects enhancements.

### Security Posture
- Next.js 14.2.33, no public token exposure, TS errors enforced, project-level auth.
- Rate limiting on sensitive routes and NextAuth login.
- Audit logging with IP/user-agent; secure cookies; CSP and headers added.

### Code Quality
- TS strict; ESLint passing; >80% coverage; unit + E2E suites; predeploy gates.

### Operational Readiness
- DB migrations, env validation, health checks, deployment runbook, token rotation.
- CI/CD added (CI, preview, production with smoke tests).

### Feature Completeness
- Auth/RBAC, project detail, hold management, settings, PWA offline: complete.
- Dashboard and projects list: partial; Holds/Analytics pages: pending.

### Remaining Work
- Blockers: Execute manual QA session and document results.
- High priority: Monitor CSP in production; iterate on dashboard/projects list.

### Risk Assessment
- Low: security, data integrity, performance.
- Medium: operational automation now addressed; UX gaps remain for some pages.

### Go/No-Go
- Before QA: No-Go. After QA pass: Go with caveats (feature gaps noted).

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- Sentry (optional), Vercel analytics, user feedback, success metrics dashboard.

### Sign-Off
- Technical lead, product owner, security, and QA approvals required.
