## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

**1. Service Worker Update Delay**
- **Issue:** Users may see old version for up to 24 hours after deployment
- **Workaround:** Instruct users to close all tabs and reopen
- **Fix:** Implement force-update mechanism (future enhancement)
- **Priority:** Low

**2. Offline Cache Expiration**
- **Issue:** Cached data expires after 5 minutes offline
- **Workaround:** Users should sync when back online
- **Fix:** Increase cache TTL to 15 minutes (future enhancement)
- **Priority:** Low

**3. Large Project Lists**
- **Issue:** Users with >500 projects may experience slow filtering
- **Workaround:** Use search instead of scrolling
- **Fix:** Implement server-side filtering (future enhancement)
- **Priority:** Medium

### Limitations (By Design)

**1. Read-Only for Most Fields**
- **Limitation:** Can only update hold status, not other project fields
- **Reason:** Quickbase is source of truth for project data
- **Future:** May add more editable fields based on user feedback

**2. No Project Creation**
- **Limitation:** Cannot create new projects in app
- **Reason:** Project creation happens in Quickbase with complex workflows
- **Workaround:** Create projects in Quickbase, they'll appear in app automatically

**3. Limited to Assigned Projects**
- **Limitation:** Closers/setters only see their own projects
- **Reason:** Role-based access control for data security
- **Workaround:** Office leaders and regional managers see all projects in their scope
