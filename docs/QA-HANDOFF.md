## Known Issues & Flaky Tests

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ **Offline tests failing** - Fixed by adding data-testid attributes to components
2. ✅ **Coverage excluding lib/** - Fixed by updating vitest.config.ts

## Compliance & Audit Logging

### Audit Logs Feature (Phase 5D)

**Purpose:** Track all administrative actions for compliance, security monitoring, and troubleshooting.

**What's Logged:**
- User profile updates (name, email, phone changes)
- Password changes (user-initiated and admin resets)
- User management (create, update, deactivate users)
- Office management (create, update, delete offices)
- System settings changes (Quickbase config, SLA defaults, hold reasons)
- Export events (CSV downloads)

**Audit Log Fields:**
- Timestamp (when action occurred)
- User (who performed the action)
- Action type (login, logout, create, update, delete, export)
- Resource (what was affected: user, office, system_settings, etc.)
- Resource ID (specific record affected)
- Changes (JSON diff showing old → new values)
- IP Address (where request came from)
- User Agent (browser/device information)

**Access:**
- Only super_admin role can view audit logs
- Available at: Settings → Audit Logs tab

**Features:**
- **Date Range Filter:** View logs from specific time period (default: last 30 days)
- **Action Filter:** Filter by action type (create, update, delete, etc.)
- **Search:** Search by user name, resource type, or IP address
- **Pagination:** 50 logs per page for performance
- **Detail View:** Click "Details" to see full JSON diff of changes
- **CSV Export:** Download filtered logs for external analysis

**Compliance Use Cases:**

1. **Security Audit:**
   - Filter by action: "delete"
   - Review all deletion events
   - Verify deletions were authorized

2. **User Activity Tracking:**
   - Search by user name
   - Review all actions by specific user
   - Identify unusual activity patterns

3. **Change History:**
   - Filter by resource: "system_settings"
   - Review all configuration changes
   - Verify changes were approved

4. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Filter by date range (incident timeframe)
   - Search by affected resource
   - Review sequence of events
   - Export to CSV for detailed analysis

**Retention Policy:**
- Audit logs are retained indefinitely (no automatic deletion)
- Manual cleanup can be performed via database queries if needed
- Recommend quarterly export to long-term storage

**Testing Audit Logs:**

```bash
# Run audit logs E2E tests
npm run test:integration tests/integration/auditLogs.spec.ts

# Verify audit logging in other tests
npm run test:integration tests/integration/userManagement.spec.ts
npm run test:integration tests/integration/systemSettings.spec.ts
```

**Verification Checklist:**
- [ ] Audit logs table created in database
- [ ] All admin actions generate audit logs
- [ ] JSON diffs show old → new values correctly
- [ ] Date range filter works
- [ ] Action filter works
- [ ] Search works (user, resource, IP)
- [ ] Pagination works for large datasets
- [ ] Detail dialog shows full log information
- [ ] CSV export generates valid file
- [ ] Only super_admin can access audit logs
- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 on API access

### Potential Flaky Tests

**1. Dashboard auto-refresh test**
- **File:** `tests/integration/dashboard.spec.ts`
- **Test:** 'refreshes data automatically'
- **Issue:** Waits 60 seconds for refetchInterval, may timeout in CI
- **TODO:** Consider reducing refetchInterval in test environment or mocking timers
- **Severity:** Low (can be skipped in CI)

**2. Offline sync timing**
- **File:** `tests/integration/offline.spec.ts`
- **Test:** 'syncs queued mutations when coming back online'
- **Issue:** Sync may take variable time depending on network/API latency
- **TODO:** Add longer timeout or poll for sync completion
- **Severity:** Medium (may fail intermittently in CI)

**3. Cache expiration test**
- **File:** `tests/integration/offline.spec.ts`
- **Test:** 'handles cache expiration'
- **Issue:** Manipulating Date.now may not work consistently across browsers
- **TODO:** Consider using fake timers or IndexedDB manipulation instead
- **Severity:** Medium (may fail in certain browsers)

### Action Items for Future

**High Priority:**
- [ ] Add visual regression testing (Percy, Chromatic, or Playwright screenshots)
- [ ] Add performance testing (Lighthouse CI)
- [ ] Add accessibility testing (axe-core)

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] Add component tests for React components (Vitest + Testing Library)
- [ ] Add API route tests (mock NextAuth session)
- [ ] Add load testing (k6 or Artillery)

**Low Priority:**
- [ ] Add mutation testing (Stryker)
- [ ] Add contract testing for Quickbase API
- [ ] Add security testing (OWASP ZAP)

## Running Tests Locally

### Prerequisites
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Install Playwright browsers: `npm run playwright:install`
3. Set up environment: `npm run setup:all`
4. Start dev server: `npm run dev` (in separate terminal)

### Quick Test Commands

**Run everything:**
```bash
npm run test:all
```

**Run unit tests only:**
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

**Run E2E tests only:**
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

**Generate coverage report:**
```bash
npm run test:coverage:report
```

**Debug failing test:**
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### CI Integration

**GitHub Actions / CI Pipeline:**
```bash
npm run test:ci
```

This command:
1. Runs all unit tests with coverage
2. Runs all E2E tests on chromium + iPad
3. Generates coverage reports (HTML + LCOV)
4. Exits with code 1 if any test fails

**Coverage artifacts:**
- `tests/coverage/index.html` - HTML coverage report
- `tests/coverage/lcov.info` - LCOV format for CI tools
- `tests/coverage/coverage-final.json` - JSON format

**Test artifacts:**
- `playwright-report/index.html` - E2E test report
- `test-results/` - Individual test results and screenshots

---

## Test Data Requirements

**Database:**
- 5 test users (closer, setter, office leader, regional, super admin)
- Created via `npm run setup:seed`
- Credentials documented in `SETUP.md`

**Quickbase:**
- Requires live Quickbase connection with valid token
- Tests use real API (not mocked) for integration tests
- Ensure test user has access to projects in Quickbase

**Note:** E2E tests require actual Quickbase data. If no projects exist for test user, some tests may fail or show empty states.

## Next Steps (Phase 5B)

After QA approval:
1. Security hardening (HTTPS cookies, rate limiting, input validation)
2. Observability (Sentry, logging, monitoring)
3. Production deployment preparation
