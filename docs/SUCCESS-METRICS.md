# Success Metrics Dashboard - Kin Home Sales Pipeline

**Purpose:** Define and track KPIs to measure the success of the new pipeline dashboard.

---

## Success Criteria

**Primary Goals:**
1. **Adoption:** 90%+ of sales team uses app daily within 30 days
2. **Efficiency:** 30%+ increase in task completion rate vs Quickbase
3. **Speed:** 50% reduction in hold resolution time
4. **Performance:** <2 second load times for all pages

---

## Adoption Metrics

### Daily Active Users (DAU)

**Definition:** Unique users who login at least once per day

**Target:** 90%+ of sales team (closers + setters)

**Measurement:**
- Track via Vercel Analytics or custom analytics
- Query: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM sessions WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'`
- Dashboard: Line chart showing DAU over time

**Baseline:** 0% (new app)

**Milestones:**
- Week 1: 50% DAU
- Week 2: 75% DAU
- Week 4: 90% DAU
- Ongoing: Maintain 90%+ DAU

**Red Flags:**
- DAU drops below 80% (investigate why users aren't using app)
- Specific office has low adoption (may need additional training)

### PWA Installation Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of users who install app on iPad home screen

**Target:** 80%+ of iPad users

**Measurement:**
- Track via service worker analytics
- Survey users: "Have you installed the app on your iPad?"
- Check for standalone mode: `window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches`

**Baseline:** 0% (new app)

**Milestones:**
- Week 1: 40% installed
- Week 2: 60% installed
- Week 4: 80% installed

**Red Flags:**
- Installation rate <50% after 2 weeks (may need better onboarding)

### Login Success Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of login attempts that succeed

**Target:** >99%

**Measurement:**
- Track via NextAuth callbacks or custom logging
- Query: `(successful_logins / total_login_attempts) * 100`

**Baseline:** N/A (new app)

**Red Flags:**
- Success rate <95% (password issues, account problems)
- Spike in failed logins (potential security issue)

---

## Performance Metrics

### Page Load Times

**Definition:** Time from navigation to page fully loaded

**Targets:**
- Dashboard: <2 seconds
- Projects List: <2 seconds
- Project Detail: <1.5 seconds

**Measurement:**
- Track via Vercel Analytics (Web Vitals)
- Track via Sentry Performance Monitoring
- Lighthouse CI in GitHub Actions
- Custom logging: `window.performance.timing`

**Baseline:** N/A (new app)

**Metrics to Track:**
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** <2.5 seconds (good)
- **FID (First Input Delay):** <100ms (good)
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** <0.1 (good)
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte):** <600ms (good)

**Red Flags:**
- Any page >3 seconds (investigate slow queries, large payloads)
- LCP >4 seconds (poor user experience)

### API Response Times

**Definition:** Time for Quickbase API calls to complete

**Target:** <1 second (95th percentile)

**Measurement:**
- Track via custom logging in `lib/quickbase/client.ts`
- Log format: `[QB] POST /v1/records/query - 245ms - 15 records`
- Aggregate in Sentry or custom dashboard

**Baseline:** Unknown (measure first week)

**Metrics to Track:**
- **p50 (median):** <500ms
- **p95 (95th percentile):** <1 second
- **p99 (99th percentile):** <2 seconds
- **Slow queries:** Count of queries >2 seconds

**Red Flags:**
- p95 >2 seconds (Quickbase performance issue)
- Spike in slow queries (investigate query complexity)

### Offline Sync Success Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of queued mutations that sync successfully

**Target:** >95%

**Measurement:**
- Track via custom logging in `lib/offline/syncQueue.ts`
- Log format: `[SYNC] success - synced: 3, failed: 0`
- Aggregate sync events: `(synced / (synced + failed)) * 100`

**Baseline:** N/A (new feature)

**Red Flags:**
- Success rate <90% (investigate retry logic, API errors)
- High retry counts (network issues, API instability)

---

## Business Metrics

### Task Completion Rate

**Definition:** Percentage of daily tasks completed by reps

**Target:** 30%+ increase vs Quickbase baseline

**Measurement:**
- Survey reps: "How many tasks did you complete today?"
- Compare to Quickbase usage logs (before app launch)
- Track specific tasks:
  - Projects reviewed
  - Holds placed/released
  - Customer contacts made

**Baseline:** Measure Quickbase usage for 2 weeks before launch

**Milestones:**
- Week 2: 10% increase
- Week 4: 20% increase
- Week 8: 30% increase

**Red Flags:**
- No increase or decrease (app may be harder to use than Quickbase)

### Hold Resolution Time

**Definition:** Average days from hold placed to hold released

**Target:** 50% reduction vs Quickbase baseline

**Measurement:**
- Query Quickbase: `AVG(DATE_RELEASED - DATE_ON_HOLD)` for projects with holds
- Compare before and after app launch
- Track by hold type (Finance, Roof, Customer, etc.)

**Baseline:** Measure Quickbase data for 3 months before launch

**Example Baseline:**
- Finance holds: 14 days average
- Roof holds: 21 days average
- Customer holds: 10 days average

**Targets:**
- Finance holds: <7 days
- Roof holds: <10 days
- Customer holds: <5 days

**Red Flags:**
- Hold resolution time increases (app may not be surfacing urgent holds effectively)

### Time to Find Project Status

**Definition:** Time from opening app to viewing project status

**Target:** <3 seconds (vs 30+ seconds in Quickbase)

**Measurement:**
- User testing: Time users with stopwatch
- Track via custom analytics: `time_to_first_project_view`
- Survey users: "How long does it take to find a project?"

**Baseline:** 30-60 seconds in Quickbase (measured via user testing)

**Target:** <3 seconds in new app

**Red Flags:**
- Users report it takes >10 seconds (investigate search, filters, performance)

---

## User Satisfaction

**Definition:** "How likely are you to recommend this app to a colleague?" (0-10 scale)

**Target:** NPS >50 (Excellent)

**Measurement:**

**Baseline:** N/A (new app)

**Benchmarks:**
- NPS >50: Excellent
- NPS 30-50: Good
- NPS 0-30: Needs improvement
- NPS <0: Critical issues
