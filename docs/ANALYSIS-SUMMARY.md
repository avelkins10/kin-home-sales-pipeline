## 3. PROJECT STATUS VALUES (Field 255)

### Distribution from 500 Projects:

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Active | 206 | 41.2% |
| Active - On Hold | 107 | 21.4% |
| Completed | 93 | 18.6% |

| Active - Installed | 7 | 1.4% |

### Hold/Blocker Analysis:
- **107 projects** (21.4%) are "Active - On Hold"
- This is a significant portion - roughly 1 in 5 active projects

### Key Insights:
- Most projects are "Active" (41%)
- High hold rate indicates workflow bottlenecks
- "Active - PTO" and "Active - Installed" are late-stage statuses

## 4. USER/TEAM FIELDS

### Total User Fields: 191 fields

### Key Team Assignment Fields:

| Field ID | Field Name | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| 4 | Record Owner | Project owner |
| 516 | Closer ID | Sales closer ID |
| 517 | Closer Name | Sales closer name |
| 329 | Setter ID | Lead setter ID |
| 330 | Setter Name | Lead setter name |
| 819 | Project Coordinator ID | PC ID |
| 820 | Project Coordinator | PC name |

### User Field Structure:
User fields store **objects** with properties:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "id": "123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "userName": "jdoe"
}
```

### Filtering for Current User:
- Use user field IDs (516, 329, 819) to filter by specific team members
- Quickbase supports filtering by `{UserField.EX.CurrentUser}` in queries
- Can query: "Show me projects where I'm the Closer" or "where I'm the PC"

### Pattern:
- **ID fields** = numeric user identifier
- **Name fields** = text display name (for formulas/display)

## 6. RECENT PROJECTS FLOW ANALYSIS

### Sample: Last 100 Projects

**Flow Timing (Sales â†’ Install Complete):**
- **Projects with complete data:** 60/100 (60%)
- **Average duration:** 135 days
- **Median duration:** 91 days
- **Range:** 1 - 910 days
- **Note:** Wide range suggests high variability in project timelines

### Status Distribution (Recent 100):

| Status | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Active | 42 | 42.0% |
| Active - On Hold | 21 | 21.0% |
| Cancelled | 20 | 20.0% |
| Completed | 17 | 17.0% |

### Holds/Blockers:
- **21 projects** with holds/blockers
- **21.0%** of recent projects are on hold
- Consistent with overall hold rate (~21%)

### Key Insights:

1. **High Cancellation Rate:** 20% of recent projects cancelled
2. **Significant Hold Rate:** 21% on hold - major workflow concern
3. **Variable Timelines:** 91 days median, but can range from 1-910 days
4. **Data Completeness:** Only 60% have both Sales Date and Install Complete Date
   - Suggests many projects still in progress or missing data

### Completion Funnel:
- 42% Active (in progress)
- 21% On Hold (blocked)
- 20% Cancelled (lost)
- 17% Completed (success)

**Success Rate:** Only 17% of recent 100 projects completed
**At Risk:** 21% on hold + 20% cancelled = 41% problematic

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Hold/Blocker Management
- **Priority 1:** Address the 21% hold rate
- Investigate common hold reasons (field 232)
- Track who's placing holds (field 234)
- Monitor hold duration

### 2. Timeline Optimization
- **Current:** 91 day median (Sales â†’ Install)
- Wide variance (1-910 days) suggests process inconsistencies
- Focus on reducing outliers

### 3. Data Tracking
- 40% of projects missing complete timeline data
- Improve data entry for milestone dates
- Focus on high-usage date fields (52%+ usage):
  - Install Completed Date (534)
  - Install Scheduled Date Capture (710)

### 4. User Assignment Clarity
- Use dedicated ID fields (516, 329, 819) for filtering
- Implement role-based dashboards
- Track team performance by Closer/Setter/PC

### 5. Task Management
- Tasks table has 589 fields but low usage
- Consider simplifying task workflow
- Focus on key task types: Permit, Survey, Pre-Intake, Funding
