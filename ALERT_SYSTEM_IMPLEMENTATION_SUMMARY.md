## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Coordinator Lookup
- Fetches project coordinator email from QuickBase
- Handles tasks with/without QuickBase associations
- Graceful fallback for missing data

### 2. User Preferences
- Email enabled/disabled toggle
- Email frequency (immediate, daily, weekly)
- Quiet hours (no emails during specified times)
- Notification type selection (per-event control)
- Preferences respected in notification creation

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
- Checks for similar notifications within 1 hour
- Prevents notification spam
- Logs duplicate attempts

### 4. Email Delivery
- Event-specific templates with colors and icons
- Recommended actions for each event type
- Multiple CTAs (dashboard, tracker, Arrivy)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive logging

### 5. UI Integration
- Dashboard bell shows unread count
- NotificationCenter includes Arrivy alerts
- Dedicated Alerts page with filtering
- Settings page for preference management
- Navigation item in TopNavbar

### 6. Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing data
- QuickBase API failures don't block webhooks
- Email failures don't block notification creation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Reuse Existing Infrastructure
- Extended notifications table (no new tables)
- Extended pc_notification_preferences (no schema changes)
- Leveraged existing email system
- Used existing UI components

### 2. Coordinator Lookup Strategy
- Fetch from QuickBase using project record ID
- Skip notification if no QuickBase association
- Log all lookup attempts for debugging

### 3. Notification Priority
- LATE, NOSHOW, EXCEPTION: critical
- CANCELLED: normal
- STARTED, COMPLETE: normal

### 4. Email Template Design
- Event-specific colors and icons
- Clear recommended actions
- Multiple CTAs for different needs
- Mobile-responsive layout

### 5. Preference Defaults
- Email disabled by default (avoid spam)
- All notification types enabled by default
- Immediate frequency by default
- No quiet hours by default

## Database Impact
- New notification types added to existing enum
- New source type added to existing enum
- New metadata structure (JSONB - no migration needed)
- Default preferences updated

## API Endpoints Added
- GET /api/operations/settings/notification-preferences
- POST /api/operations/settings/notification-preferences

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- getCoordinatorEmailForTask() function
- getNotificationTypeForArrivyEvent() function
- getNotificationTitleForArrivyEvent() function
- Email template generation
- Duplicate prevention logic

### Integration Tests Needed
- End-to-end notification creation flow
- Email delivery with preferences
- Quiet hours enforcement
- Alerts page filtering
- Settings page save/load

### Manual Tests
- See ARRIVY_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md for comprehensive test plan
- All 25 tests should pass

## Performance Considerations
- Coordinator lookup adds QuickBase API call per event
- Cached coordinator emails could be added if needed
- Duplicate check queries notifications table (indexed)
- Email sending is non-blocking (errors logged, not thrown)

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access to alerts page
- Role-based access to settings page
- Email addresses validated against QuickBase
- No sensitive data in notification metadata
- Webhook signature verification already in place

## Future Enhancements
1. **In-memory cache for coordinator emails** (5-minute TTL)
2. **Batch email sending** for daily/weekly digests
3. **Push notifications** via web push API
4. **SMS alerts** for critical events (Twilio integration exists but not connected to Arrivy alerts)
5. **Alert acknowledgment** workflow
6. **Alert escalation** if not acknowledged
7. **Custom notification rules** per user
8. **Alert templates** per organization

**Note on SMS:** While the system has Twilio SMS capabilities for other features (communications, outreach), SMS alerts for Arrivy field events are intentionally excluded from this implementation. This is Phase 1 focusing on email + in-app notifications only. SMS can be added in Phase 2 by creating `sendArrivyFieldAlertSms()` in `lib/integrations/twilio/sms.ts` and calling it conditionally based on user preferences.

## Dependencies
- Existing notification system
- Existing email system (nodemailer)
- QuickBase integration
- Arrivy webhook system
- React Query for data fetching
- shadcn/ui components
- date-fns for date formatting

## Environment Variables Required
- EMAIL_ENABLED=true (for email delivery)
- EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_FROM (existing)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (for email links)
- All existing Arrivy and QuickBase env vars

## Rollout Plan
1. Deploy to staging
2. Run all tests from ARRIVY_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md
3. Verify Phase 7 from ARRIVY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
4. Test with real Arrivy events
5. Monitor logs for errors
6. Deploy to production
7. Monitor production logs
8. Gather user feedback

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ All notification types create successfully
- ‚úÖ Email delivery rate >95%
- ‚úÖ No duplicate notifications
- ‚úÖ Coordinator lookup success rate >90%
- ‚úÖ User preferences respected 100%
- ‚úÖ Alerts page loads <2 seconds
- ‚úÖ Settings page saves successfully
- ‚úÖ No errors in production logs

## Known Limitations
1. Tasks without QuickBase link don't create notifications (by design)
2. Coordinator email must exist in QuickBase PROJECT_COORDINATOR_EMAIL field
3. Email delivery depends on EMAIL_ENABLED env var
4. No mobile push notifications (future enhancement - Phase 2)
5. No SMS alerts for Arrivy events (email-only for Phase 1; Twilio SMS exists but not integrated)
6. No alert acknowledgment workflow (future enhancement - Phase 2)

## Maintenance Notes
- Monitor notification creation logs for failures
- Review email delivery logs for bounce/spam issues
- Check duplicate prevention logs for potential issues
- Update notification types if new Arrivy events added
- Update email templates if branding changes
- Add new notification types to Settings page UI

## Support Documentation
- See ARRIVY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for deployment steps
- See ARRIVY_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md for testing procedures

- See type definitions for data structures

## Summary
The alert system has been successfully implemented with comprehensive features, error handling, and user preferences. All files compile without linter errors. The system is ready for testing following the procedures in ARRIVY_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md and deployment following ARRIVY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md Phase 7.
