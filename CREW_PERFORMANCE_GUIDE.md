## Data Sources

All metrics are calculated from Arrivy data:
- **arrivy_tasks:** Task assignments and scheduling
- **arrivy_task_status:** Status updates with timestamps
- **arrivy_events:** Customer ratings and exceptions
- **arrivy_entities:** Crew member information

## Calculations

### Tasks Completed
```sql
COUNT(*) WHERE status_type = 'COMPLETE' 
AND reported_at >= [date_boundary]
GROUP BY entity_id
```

### Average Completion Time
```sql
AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (complete_time - start_time)) / 60)
WHERE status_type IN ('STARTED', 'COMPLETE')
```

### On-Time Percentage
```sql
(COUNT(*) WHERE started_at <= scheduled_start) / COUNT(*) * 100
```

### Customer Rating Average
```sql
AVG(extra_fields->>'rating'::integer)
FROM arrivy_events
WHERE event_type = 'TASK_RATING'
```

## Usage

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to Operations â†’ Crew Performance
2. Select desired time range and filters
3. View metrics, charts, and tables

### Exporting Data
1. Click "Export to CSV" button in header
2. CSV file downloads with all crew metrics
3. Filename format: `crew-performance-{timeRange}-{date}.csv`

### Identifying Issues
1. Check "Needs Support" card for crew members with issues
2. Review specific metrics in performance table
3. Use comparison chart to identify outliers
4. Click crew member to view detailed breakdown

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching:** Results cached for 60 seconds to reduce database load
- **Auto-Refresh:** Dashboard updates every 60 seconds
- **Query Optimization:** Uses indexed columns for fast aggregation
- **Pagination:** Performance table shows all crew members (typically < 50)

## Troubleshooting

### No Crew Members Showing
- Verify entities synced from Arrivy: `npm run sync:arrivy:entities`
- Check database: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM arrivy_entities;`
- Ensure crew members have assigned tasks

### Metrics Show Zero
- Verify tasks exist in selected time range
- Check task status history has COMPLETE statuses
- Confirm crew members are assigned to tasks (assigned_entity_ids)

### Ratings Not Appearing
- Verify TASK_RATING webhook is enabled
- Check arrivy_events table for TASK_RATING events
- Confirm customers are leaving ratings via tracker URLs

## Future Enhancements

- Individual crew detail pages with task history
- Trend charts showing performance over time
- Automated performance reports via email
- Goal setting and tracking per crew member
- Integration with QuickBase for project context
