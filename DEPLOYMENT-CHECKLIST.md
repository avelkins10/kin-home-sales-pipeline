# AI Hold Resolution Assistant - Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
- [ ] Verify `QUICKBASE_TOKEN` is valid and has necessary permissions
- [ ] Set `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` for secure sessions
- [ ] Configure `DATABASE_URL` for your Neon PostgreSQL instance

### 2. OpenAI API Setup
- [ ] Create OpenAI account and get API key
- [ ] Set up billing with appropriate limits ($50-100/month recommended)
- [ ] Test API key with a simple request
- [ ] Configure usage alerts in OpenAI dashboard

### 3. Database Setup
- [ ] Ensure Neon PostgreSQL is accessible
- [ ] Run any pending migrations
- [ ] Verify database has proper indexes for performance

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Deployment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 2. Feature Flag Configuration
- [ ] Enable `ai_hold_analysis` for all roles
- [ ] Set `ai_batch_analysis` to 50% rollout for managers
- [ ] Enable `ai_feedback` for all users
- [ ] Keep `ai_smart_notifications` disabled initially

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure Vercel Analytics
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry if configured)
- [ ] Monitor OpenAI API usage and costs
- [ ] Set up alerts for high error rates

## Post-Deployment Testing

### 1. Basic Functionality
- [ ] Login as different user roles (closer, setter, manager)
- [ ] Navigate to a project that's on hold
- [ ] Verify AI analysis card appears
- [ ] Test loading states and error handling
- [ ] Verify caching works correctly

### 2. AI Analysis Testing
Test with these example hold reasons:

**Finance Hold:**
```
Customer needs to provide updated bank statements for loan approval. 
Lender requires additional documentation before proceeding.
```

**HOA Hold:**
```
HOA board meeting scheduled for next month to review solar installation. 
Need approval before proceeding with design.
```

**Roof Hold:**
```
Roof inspection revealed structural issues that need to be addressed 
before solar installation can proceed.
```

**Customer Hold:**
```
Customer is reconsidering the system size and wants to discuss options 
before moving forward.
```

### 3. Error Scenarios
- [ ] Test with invalid project ID
- [ ] Test with project not on hold
- [ ] Test with empty hold reason
- [ ] Test with very long hold reason (>1000 characters)
- [ ] Test offline functionality
- [ ] Test rate limiting scenarios

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] Verify AI analysis loads within 3 seconds
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Verify caching reduces API calls
- [ ] Test batch analysis with 5+ projects

## User Acceptance Testing

### 1. Sales Rep Testing
- [ ] Rep can see AI suggestions for their projects
- [ ] Suggestions are relevant and actionable
- [ ] Can provide feedback on suggestions
- [ ] Can copy actions to clipboard
- [ ] Can take actions directly from suggestions

### 2. Manager Testing
- [ ] Can see AI analysis for team projects
- [ ] Batch analysis works for multiple projects
- [ ] Can toggle AI insights on/off
- [ ] Analytics show usage patterns

### 3. Edge Cases
- [ ] Projects with multiple holds
- [ ] Very old holds (>30 days)
- [ ] Non-English hold reasons
- [ ] Projects with missing data

## Monitoring & Analytics

### 1. Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] AI analysis request success rate
- [ ] Average response time
- [ ] User feedback scores
- [ ] Hold resolution time improvement
- [ ] Cost per analysis
- [ ] Cache hit rate

### 2. Alerts to Set Up
- [ ] OpenAI API errors >5%
- [ ] Response time >5 seconds
- [ ] Daily cost >$30
- [ ] Cache hit rate <50%
- [ ] User feedback <70% helpful

### 3. Weekly Reviews
- [ ] Review AI suggestion quality
- [ ] Analyze user feedback patterns
- [ ] Monitor cost trends
- [ ] Check for new hold patterns
- [ ] Update prompts based on feedback

## Rollback Plan

### 1. Emergency Disable
```typescript
// In lib/features/flags.ts
export function emergencyDisableFeature('ai_hold_analysis'): boolean {
  // This will immediately disable AI for all users
}
```

### 2. Gradual Rollback
- [ ] Reduce rollout percentage to 0%
- [ ] Disable for specific user roles
- [ ] Disable for specific offices
- [ ] Revert to previous deployment

### 3. Data Recovery
- [ ] Ensure all user feedback is saved
- [ ] Backup AI analysis cache
- [ ] Preserve analytics data
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] 80% of users can access AI analysis
- [ ] <3 second average response time
