## Key Features Implemented

### Metrics Tracked
1. **Tasks Completed** - Today, week, month, total with date-based aggregation
2. **Average Completion Time** - Calculated from STARTED to COMPLETE status
3. **On-Time Percentage** - Tasks started on/before scheduled time
4. **Customer Ratings** - Average rating from TASK_RATING events
5. **Active Tasks** - Currently assigned tasks (NOT_STARTED, ENROUTE, STARTED)
6. **Exception Rates** - EXCEPTION and NOSHOW event counts
7. **Delayed Tasks** - Tasks started after scheduled time

### Dashboard Sections
1. **Metrics Overview** - 6 cards with team aggregates, auto-refresh
2. **Top Performers** - Leaderboard with top 5 crew members, rankings
3. **Needs Support** - Identifies low performers, suggests actions
4. **Comparison Chart** - Horizontal bars with team average reference
5. **Performance Table** - Sortable, color-coded, clickable rows

### Filters & Controls
- **Time Range:** 7 days, 30 days (default), 90 days, all time
- **Crew Member:** All crew (default), individual selection
- **Task Type:** All tasks (default), survey, install, inspection, service
- **Comparison Metric:** Tasks completed, completion time, on-time %, ratings

### Data Processing
- **Caching:** 60-second TTL, max 50 entries, automatic cleanup
- **Query Optimization:** CTEs for clarity, indexed columns, LIMIT for top/bottom
- **Parallel Fetching:** Promise.all for metrics, averages, leaderboard
- **Auto-Refresh:** React Query with 60-second refetch interval

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Arrivy Tasks → PostgreSQL (arrivy_tasks, arrivy_task_status, arrivy_entities, arrivy_events)
                    ↓
            Complex SQL Aggregation (CTEs)
                    ↓
            API Endpoint (/api/operations/crew-performance)
                    ↓
            React Query (60s cache + refetch)
                    ↓
            Dashboard UI (page.tsx)
                    ↓
            Components (Table, Charts, Cards)
```

### Database Queries
- **Primary Query:** 5 CTEs (completed_tasks, task_durations, ratings, active_tasks, exceptions)
- **Aggregation Functions:** COUNT, AVG, SUM, CASE WHEN, UNNEST, DATE_TRUNC
- **Joins:** arrivy_entities, arrivy_tasks, arrivy_task_status, arrivy_events
- **Filters:** timeRange, crewMember, taskType

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Indexed Columns:** arrivy_task_id, reported_at, event_type, arrivy_entity_id
2. **Result Limiting:** Top 10 for charts, pagination for tables
3. **In-Memory Caching:** 60-second TTL reduces database load
4. **Parallel Fetching:** Multiple queries executed simultaneously
5. **Lazy Loading:** Charts and tables load on tab selection
