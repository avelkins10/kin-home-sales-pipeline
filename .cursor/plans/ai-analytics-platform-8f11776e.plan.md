# AI Analytics Platform Implementation Plan

## Overview

Extend existing analytics dashboards at `app/(dashboard)/analytics/` with AI-powered pattern recognition, smart alerting, and contextual insights. Focus on actionable patterns that address the 21.4% hold rate problem.

- Surfaces best practices from top performers
- Suggests team-wide process improvements

### 4. Lever Impact Visualization

**Create:** `components/analytics/LeverImpactMatrix.tsx`

- 2x2 matrix visualizing Impact vs. Effort
- Bubble size represents potential revenue impact
- Click bubbles for detailed implementation plans
- Track progress on initiatives

## Phase 3: Smart Alert System (Week 3)

### 1. Alert Generation Engine

**Create:** `lib/ai/alerts/smartAlerts.ts`

- `generateDailyAlerts()` - analyzes user's projects for critical patterns
- `generateRepAlerts()` - personal alerts for sales reps
- `generateManagerAlerts()` - team-level alerts for managers
- `generateExecutiveAlerts()` - strategic alerts for leadership
- Alert types: risk, opportunity, insight, action

**Create:** `lib/ai/alerts/alertPrioritizer.ts`

- Prioritizes alerts by urgency and potential impact
- Prevents alert fatigue by limiting to top 3-5 daily
- Learns from user feedback on alert usefulness

### 2. Alert UI Components

**Create:** `components/ai/SmartAlertBar.tsx`

- Floating alert bar on dashboard showing daily insights
- Dismissible alerts with "Mark as done" functionality
- Links to relevant projects or actions
- Shows alert priority with color coding

**Create:** `components/ai/AlertFeedDrawer.tsx`

- Drawer component showing all recent alerts
- Filter by type (risk, opportunity, insight, action)
- Mark alerts as read/unread
- Provide feedback on alert helpfulness

### 3. Alert API Endpoints

**Create:** `app/api/ai/alerts/daily/route.ts`

- GET endpoint returning personalized daily alerts
- Filters by user role and permissions
- Returns top 5 prioritized alerts

**Create:** `app/api/ai/alerts/feedback/route.ts`

- POST endpoint for alert feedback
