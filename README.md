## Key Features

### 9-Milestone Project Timeline
1. **Intake** - Project initiation and tentative install date
2. **Survey** - Site survey and approval
3. **Design** - System design and engineering
4. **HOA** - Homeowner association approval (conditional)
5. **Permit** - Building permit submission and approval
6. **NEM** - Net Energy Metering application
7. **Install** - System installation and commissioning
8. **Verification** - System verification (calculated)
9. **Inspection** - Final inspection
10. **PTO** - Permission to Operate (final milestone)

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Closers**: Projects where they are the closer
- **Setters**: Projects where they are the setter
- **Office Leaders**: Their projects + configurable office access
- **Regional**: Multiple offices (configurable)
- **Super Admin**: All projects + SLA configuration

### Real-Time Data
- Quickbase API integration with 10 req/sec rate limiting
- Request queuing and exponential backoff
- 30-second cache with React Query
- Optimistic updates for instant feedback

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization

The app uses NextAuth.js with credential-based authentication:

- **Password Security:** Bcrypt hashing with 10 salt rounds
- **Session Security:** JWT tokens with 30-day expiration
- **Cookie Security:** HTTPS-only, httpOnly, sameSite=lax in production
- **Role-Based Access:** 5 roles (closer, setter, office_leader, regional, super_admin)

### API Security

**Authorization Guards:**
```typescript
import { requireAuth, requireRole } from '@/lib/auth/guards'

// Require authentication
const auth = await requireAuth()
if (!auth.authorized) return auth.response

// Require specific role
const auth = await requireRole(['super_admin'])
if (!auth.authorized) return auth.response
```

**Protected Routes:**
- `/api/projects/[id]/hold` - Requires authentication
- All dashboard pages - Requires authentication (layout guard)

### Error Tracking (Optional)

To enable Sentry error tracking:

1. Install Sentry:
   ```bash
   npm install @sentry/nextjs
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   SENTRY_DSN=your-server-dsn
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-client-dsn
   ```

3. Restart app - Sentry will automatically capture errors

**Without Sentry:** App logs errors to console (available in Vercel logs)

### Security Audit

Run security audit:
```bash
npm run audit:prod        # Check production dependencies
npm run audit:fix         # Auto-fix vulnerabilities
npm run audit:report      # Generate JSON report
```

See `docs/SECURITY-READINESS.md` for detailed security documentation.

**CRITICAL: Environment Variables**
- The `.env.local` file contains sensitive credentials and is automatically ignored by git
- Never commit live tokens, database URLs, or secrets to version control
- Always use placeholder values in documentation and examples
- Generate fresh tokens for each environment (development, staging, production)
 - For audit logging to function, set `INTERNAL_API_SECRET` in all environments (local `.env.local`, CI secrets, and hosting provider env vars). Do not prefix with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. The internal audit API at `/api/internal/audit` validates the `x-internal-secret` header against this value.

## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run type-check   # Run TypeScript compiler
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions enforces quality gates on every PR and push:
- Type check, lint, unit tests (with coverage), E2E tests, build, audit
- Preview deploys for non-main branches
- Manual production deploy with smoke tests

See `docs/CI-CD-SETUP.md` for setup, secrets, and branch protection rules.

### Setup Scripts

```bash
npm run setup:env      # Validate .env.local configuration
npm run setup:db       # Initialize database schema
npm run setup:seed     # Create test users
npm run setup:health   # Validate all integrations
npm run setup:all      # Run all setup steps in sequence
```

See **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** for detailed documentation.

### Data Integration

The app integrates with Quickbase using the official REST API v1 specification:

- **92 Field Constants**: All project fields mapped with usage percentages
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests/second with request queuing
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Field Format**: All fields returned as `{ "fieldId": { "value": "data" } }`

### Critical Data Insights

**Low usage ≠ unreliable fields!** For example:
- PTO (20% usage) is the FINAL milestone - only completed projects have it
- HOA (10% usage) is CRITICAL for the 10% of homes that need it
- All fields ≥10% usage are included (42 fields for standard dashboard)
