# RepCard Display Configuration - Complete ✅

## Summary

All RepCard data is now properly configured to display in leaderboards and dashboards with near real-time updates.

---

## ✅ What's Configured

### 1. Leaderboard API (`/api/repcard/leaderboard`)
✅ **Uses synced database data (no API calls)**
- `doors_knocked` → `repcard_customers` table
- `appointments_set` → `repcard_appointments` table
- `sales_closed` → `repcard_status_logs` table (FIXED!)
- `revenue` → `repcard_status_logs` + `repcard_customers` (FIXED!)
- `quality_score`, `appointment_speed`, `attachment_rate` → Quality metrics

**Performance:** All queries are fast (< 500ms) because they use the database instead of API calls.

---

### 2. RepCard Data API (`/api/repcard/data`) 🆕 NEW
✅ **New endpoint for querying all synced data**

**Available types:**
- `customers` - All synced customers/leads
- `appointments` - All synced appointments  
- `attachments` - Customer + appointment attachments
- `users` - RepCard user data
- `offices` - RepCard office data
- `status_logs` - Status change history

**Example usage:**
```typescript
// Get attachments for a user
GET /api/repcard/data?type=attachments&userId=123

// Get appointments for a customer
GET /api/repcard/data?type=appointments&customerId=456
```

---

### 3. Auto-Refresh Configuration ✅
**All components refresh every 30 seconds**

**Updated components:**
- ✅ `ConfigurableLeaderboard` - Checks for updates every 30s
- ✅ `CanvassingOverviewCard` - Auto-refreshes every 30s
- ✅ `AppointmentRatesCard` - Auto-refreshes every 30s
- ✅ `RepCardMetricsCard` - Auto-refreshes every 30s

**User experience:**
- Data appears instantly (from cache)
- Checks for updates every 30 seconds
- Updates automatically when sync completes
- Feels "live" even with 5-minute sync delay

---

### 4. Dashboard Integration ✅
**RepCard metrics added to main dashboard**

**New component:** `RepCardMetricsCard`
- Shows doors knocked, appointments, conversion rate, attachments
- Quality metrics breakdown (speed, attachments, reschedules, follow-ups)
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Added to `/app/(sales)/page.tsx` (main dashboard)

## 🔄 Update Flow

### Real-Time Updates (5-minute sync + 30-second refresh)

```
9:00 AM - Rep knocks door in RepCard
    ↓
9:05 AM - Cron sync runs (incremental)
    ↓
    Pulls new customer → stores in repcard_customers
    ↓
9:05:00 - Leaderboard API queries database → sees new record
    ↓
9:05:30 - Frontend auto-refresh → component fetches updated data
    ↓
    User sees updated leaderboard!
```

**Maximum delay:** 5 minutes + 30 seconds = ~5.5 minutes  
**Typical delay:** 2-3 minutes (sync runs every 5 min, may catch it partway through)
