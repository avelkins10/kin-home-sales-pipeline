# Verification Fixes Implementation Summary

All 6 verification comments have been successfully implemented.

## ✅ Comment 1: Team Average Values Fixed

**Issue**: Team average values for ratings, exceptions, and active tasks always resolved to zero.

**Fix**: Updated `getCrewTeamAverages()` in `lib/db/arrivy.ts`:
- Added separate CTEs for `ratings`, `active_tasks`, and `exceptions` with proper date filtering
- Joined these CTEs to per-entity aggregation like in `getCrewPerformanceMetrics()`
- Changed `customer_rating_avg` to return NULL when no ratings exist (instead of 0)
- Properly computed AVG across entities for each metric

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/lib/db/arrivy.ts` (lines 1278-1433)

## ✅ Comment 2: Comparison Chart Baseline Fixed

**Issue**: Comparison chart used mismatched metric vs. baseline for "Tasks Completed" (used `tasks_completed_total` instead of `tasks_completed_month`).

**Fix**: Updated the `teamAverage` prop in `page.tsx`:
- Changed from `data.teamAverages.tasks_completed_total` 
- To `data.teamAverages.tasks_completed_month`
- Now matches the displayed data key (`tasks_completed_month`)

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/app/(operations)/operations/crew-performance/page.tsx` (line 328)

## ✅ Comment 3: Crew Filter Standardized on Entity ID

**Issue**: Crew filter sent a crew name/email, but API filtered exclusively by email with inconsistent behavior.

**Fix**: Standardized filtering on `entity_id` across all layers:

**Frontend (`page.tsx`)**:
- Changed Select value to `String(crew.entity_id)` instead of email/name
- Pass `crewId` param instead of `crewMember`
- Updated `onCrewClick` to use `entity_id` directly

**API (`route.ts`)**:
- Accept `crewId` query parameter and parse as integer
- Added validation for numeric crewId
- Pass `crewId` to database function

**Database (`arrivy.ts`)**:
- Changed function signature from `crewMember?: string` to `crewId?: number`
- Filter with `WHERE e.arrivy_entity_id = $1` using parameterized query
- Removed email/name fallback logic

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/app/(operations)/operations/crew-performance/page.tsx` (lines 47-54, 183, 353)
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/app/api/operations/crew-performance/route.ts` (lines 46-47, 59-65, 77, 91)
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/lib/db/arrivy.ts` (lines 1102, 1127-1132, 1248)

## ✅ Comment 4: SQL Injection Risks Fixed

**Issue**: Direct string interpolation in SQL introduced injection risk for `taskType` and `crewMember`.

**Fix**: Parameterized all dynamic SQL:
- Created `params` array and `paramIndex` counter
- Replaced string interpolation with parameter placeholders (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- For `taskType`: validate allowed values then bind with `LOWER($n)` comparison
- For `crewId`: bind numeric id as parameter
- Updated both `getCrewPerformanceMetrics()` and `getCrewTeamAverages()`

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/lib/db/arrivy.ts` (lines 1108-1125, 1260-1276)

## ✅ Comment 5: Today/Week/Month Counters Independent

**Issue**: "Today/Week/Month" counters were narrowed by the global timeRange filter.

**Fix**: Computed `is_today`, `is_this_week`, and `is_this_month` independent of timeRange:

**Both Functions (`getCrewPerformanceMetrics` and `getCrewTeamAverages`)**:
- Created `all_completed_tasks` CTE without dateFilter (all completed tasks)
- Created separate CTEs: `today_tasks`, `week_tasks`, `month_tasks`
  - Each filters by absolute dates (CURRENT_DATE, DATE_TRUNC('week'), DATE_TRUNC('month'))
  - Independent of the timeRange parameter
- Kept `completed_tasks` CTE with dateFilter for `tasks_completed_total` (range-limited)
- Joined all CTEs separately in main query
- Today/week/month counters now show all-time counts, while total shows range-limited count

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/lib/db/arrivy.ts` (lines 1135-1172, 1221-1252, 1308-1345, 1423-1453)

## ✅ Comment 6: Completion Time Colors Inverted

**Issue**: Completion time comparison colors were inverted (higher time showed as green).

**Fix**: Updated `CrewComparisonChart.tsx`:
- Added conditional logic for color assignment
- For `metric === 'completion_time'`: green when `value <= teamAverage`, red otherwise
- For other metrics: keep existing logic (green when >= average)
- Added clarifying comments

**Files Modified**:
- `/Users/austinelkins/Rep_Dashboard/components/operations/CrewComparisonChart.tsx` (lines 158-174)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Comment 1**: Verify team averages for ratings, exceptions, and active tasks now show correct non-zero values
2. **Comment 2**: Verify comparison chart baseline matches the month metric in the chart
3. **Comment 3**: Test crew filter by selecting different crew members and verify API receives numeric entity_id
4. **Comment 4**: SQL injection attempts should now fail safely
5. **Comment 5**: Set timeRange to "7 days" and verify today/week/month counters still show all-time values
6. **Comment 6**: Verify completion time bars are green for faster crew, red for slower crew
